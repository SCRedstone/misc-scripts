# Scripts Info

### Turn off Screen.bat
Turns off all screens kinda like laptops' screen off button. Tested working on Windows 10.

### alternate a and d + indicator.ahk
Really scuffed AutoHotKey script. Press F3 to activate. Includes a red/green indicator at the top right of your monitor to show whether it's activated. I use it to prevent getting AFK kicked.

Modify any parts to meet your needs.

### key to leftclick.ahk
AutoHotKey script to map *f* and *g* to mouse left-click. Basically play osu anywhere.
